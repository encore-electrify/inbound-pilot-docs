This document summarizes the AI assistant's call handling process across verification, intent gathering, call routing, and resolution during the Encore inbound pilot.

## Right Party Verification (RPV)

RPV ensures the caller is the correct patient on the account by gathering and verifying identifying details.

### Process Overview

- **Step 1: Collect Information**  
  The assistant collects the caller's:
  - First and last name  
  - Date of birth  
  - Full address (street, city, state, ZIP)

- **Step 2: Verify Key Data Points**
  - **Inbound Number**: Used to pre-filter eligible calls.  
  - **Name**: Verified via phonetic comparison algorithm.  
  - **Address**: Verified using similarity-based logic.  
  - **Date of Birth**: Collected but not used for verification.  
  - **Patient Status**: Used for routing, not verification.

### Outcome

- ✅ **Verified**: Both name and address meet criteria — AI proceeds.  
- ❌ **Not Verified**: Caller is asked to retry or transferred.

## 2. Call Intent Gathering

After verification, the assistant asks the caller to select their reason for calling:

- **Check Balance**  
  - Balance is provided.
  - Call ends if no further questions.
  - More complex requests → Transferred.

- **Statement Questions**  
  - Call is transferred.

- **Something Else**  
  - Caller is prompted to describe the issue.
  - Call is transferred.

## 3. Transferring Calls

### Global Transfer Conditions

Applies at any point during the call:

- Caller is upset, agitated, or uses inappropriate language.
- Caller requests a transfer.

### RPV-Specific Transfers

- Caller declines to provide name/address.
- Caller fails verification.

### Intent Handling Transfers

- Caller wants to:
  - Make a payment
  - Set up a payment arrangement
  - Discuss someone else's account
  - Ask complex or unresolved balance questions
  - Dispute a balance

### Arbitration Events

- Internal disagreement between AI models results in a hard transfer.

## 4. End of Call Handling

### Transfer End

- A static message plays:  
  `"Please hold while I transfer you to a patient service representative."`
- Call is routed to Sytel.
- Electrify workflow ends.

### Natural End

- A static message plays:  
  `"Thanks for calling Berkshire Health Systems, goodbye."`
- Workflow ends cleanly.
