This document describes how the Agent Assist feature within the Electrify portal works.

## Agent Assist

The Agent Assist feature is utilized by a live representative when a call is being transferred from Electrify to Sytel. The live representative will:

1. Be notified of the transfer.
2. Have a brief moment to review the caller information, call summary and trasncript thus far.
3. Assist the caller.
